    <h1 class="diamondTitle">What is the process of this project? </h1>
    <p class="diamondText">We purchase raw Gemstones straight from the mines, split them into tokens on the blockchain and allow anyone to purchase them.
        In the meantime, said Gemstone gets cut, polished and developed into jewellery as well as certified and appraised.
        Finally, once the Gemstone is sold, all of the token holders get their profits distributed automatically as written in the Smart Contract.
